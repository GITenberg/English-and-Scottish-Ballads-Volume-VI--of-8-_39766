<h3><a name="THE_LOCHMABEN_HARPER" id="THE_LOCHMABEN_HARPER"></a>THE LOCHMABEN HARPER.</h3>


<p>This fine old ballad was first printed in the <i>Musical
Museum</i> (<i>O heard ye e'er of a silly blind Harper</i>,
p. 598). Scott inserted a different copy, equally
good, in the <i>Border Minstrelsy</i>, i. 422, and there is
another, of very ordinary merits, in <i>Scottish Traditional
Versions of Ancient Ballads</i> (<i>The Jolly Harper</i>),
p. 37. In this the theft is done on a wager, and the
booty duly restored. On account of the excellence
of the ballad, we give two versions, though they differ
but slightly.</p>

<h3><a name="JOHNIE_OF_BREADISLEE" id="JOHNIE_OF_BREADISLEE"></a>JOHNIE OF BREADISLEE.</h3>

<h4>AN ANCIENT NITHSDALE BALLAD.</h4>

<p class="center"><i>Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border</i>, iii. 114.</p>


<p>"The hero of this ballad appears to have been an
outlaw and deer-stealer&mdash;probably one of the broken
men residing upon the Border. There are several
different copies, in one of which the principal personage
is called <i>Johnie of Cockielaw</i>. The stanzas of
greatest merit have been selected from each copy.
It is sometimes said, that this outlaw possessed the old
Castle of Morton, in Dumfries-shire, now ruinous:
"Near to this castle there was a park, built by Sir
Thomas Randolph, on the face of a very great and
high hill; so artificially, that, by the advantage of the
hill, all wild beasts, such as deers, harts, and roes, and
hares, did easily leap in, but could not get out again;
and if any other cattle, such as cows, sheep, or goats,
did voluntarily leap in, or were forced to do it,
<i>it is doubted</i> if their owners were permitted to get
them out again." <i>Account of Presbytery of Penpont,
apud Macfarlane's MSS.</i> Such a park would form
a convenient domain to an outlaw's castle, and the
mention of Durisdeer, a neighboring parish, adds
weight to this tradition."</p>

<p>Johnie of Breadislee was first printed in the <i>Border
Minstrelsy</i>. Fragments of two other versions, in
which the hero's name is Johny Cock, were given
in Fry's <i>Pieces of Ancient Poetry</i>, Bristol, 1814, p. 55,<!-- Page 12 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
and the editor did not fail to notice that he had probably
lighted on the ballad of <i>Johny Cox</i>, which Ritson
says the Rev. Mr. Boyd faintly recollected, (<i>Scottish
Song</i>, I. p. xxxvi.) Motherwell, not aware of what
Fry had done, printed a few stanzas belonging to the
first of these versions, under the title of <i>Johnie of
Braidisbank</i> (<i>Minstrelsy, Ancient and Modern</i>, p. 23),
and Kinloch recovered a nearly complete story. Another
copy of this last has been published from
Buchan's manuscripts in <i>Scottish Traditional Versions
of Ancient Ballads</i> (Percy Society, vol. xvii. p. 77).
Chambers, in his <i>Scottish Ballads</i>, p. 181, has compounded
Scott's, Kinloch's, and Motherwell's copies,
interspersing a few additional stanzas of no value.
Scott's and <a href="#JOHNIE_OF_COCKLESMUIR">Kinloch's</a> versions are given in this place,
and Fry's fragments (which contain several beautiful
stanzas) <a href="#JOHNNY_COCK_See_p_11">in the Appendix</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="THE_SANG_OF_THE_OUTLAW_MURRAY" id="THE_SANG_OF_THE_OUTLAW_MURRAY"></a>THE SANG OF THE OUTLAW MURRAY.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border</i>, i. 369.</p>


<p>"This ballad appears to have been composed about
the reign of James V. It commemorates a transaction
supposed to have taken place betwixt a Scottish
monarch and an ancestor of the ancient family of
Murray of Philiphaugh, in Selkirkshire. The Editor
is unable to ascertain the historical foundation of the
tale; nor is it probable that any light can be thrown
upon the subject, without an accurate examination of
the family charter-chest....</p>

<p>"The merit of this beautiful old tale, it is thought,
will be fully acknowledged. It has been, for ages, a
popular song in Selkirkshire. The scene is by the
common people supposed to have been the Castle of
Newark upon Yarrow. This is highly improbable,
because Newark was always a royal fortress. Indeed,
the late excellent antiquarian, Mr. Plummer, Sheriff-depute
of Selkirkshire, has assured the Editor that he
remembered the <i>insignia</i> of the unicorns, &amp;c., so often
mentioned in the ballad, in existence upon the old
Tower of Hangingshaw, the seat of the Philiphaugh
family; although, upon first perusing a copy of the
ballad, he was inclined to subscribe to the popular
opinion. The Tower of Hangingshaw has been demolished
for many years. It stood in a romantic and
solitary situation, on the classical banks of the Yarrow.
When the mountains around Hangingshaw were covered
with the wild copse which constituted a Scottish<!-- Page 21 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
forest, a more secure stronghold for an outlawed baron
can scarcely be imagined.</p>

<p>"The tradition of Ettrick Forest bears, that the
outlaw was a man of prodigious strength, possessing a
baton or club, with which he laid <i>lee</i> (<i>i. e.</i> waste) the
country for many miles round; and that he was at
length slain by Buccleuch, or some of his clan, at a
little mount, covered with fir-trees, adjoining to Newark
Castle, and said to have been a part of the garden.
A varying tradition bears the place of his death to
have been near to the house of the Duke of Buccleuch's
gamekeeper, beneath the castle; and that the
fatal arrow was shot by Scott of Haining, from the
ruins of a cottage on the opposite side of Yarrow.
There were extant, within these twenty years, some
verses of a song on his death. The feud betwixt the
Outlaw and the Scots, may serve to explain the
asperity with which the chieftain of that clan is handled
in the ballad.</p>

<p>"In publishing the following ballad, the copy principally
resorted to is one apparently of considerable
antiquity, which was found among the papers of the
late Mrs. Cockburn of Edinburgh, a lady whose memory
will be long honoured by all who knew her. Another
copy, much more imperfect, is to be found in
Glenriddel's MSS. The names are in this last miserably
mangled, as is always the case when ballads are
taken down from the recitation of persons living at a
distance from the scenes in which they are laid. Mr.
Plummer also gave the editor a few additional verses,
not contained in either copy, which are thrown into
what seemed their proper place. There is yet another
copy in Mr. Herd's MSS., which has been occasionally<!-- Page 22 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
made use of. Two verses are restored in the present
edition, from the recitation of Mr. Mungo Park, whose
toils during his patient and intrepid travels in Africa
have not eradicated from his recollection the legendary
lore of his native country."&mdash;S.</p>

<p>Since the above was printed, Mr. Aytoun has published
still another copy of this piece, (<i>Ballads of
Scotland</i>, ii. 129,) from a manuscript in the Philiphaugh
charter-chest. I cannot assent to the praise
bestowed by Scott on <i>The Outlaw Murray</i>. The story
lacks point, and the style is affected&mdash;not that of the
unconscious poet of the real <i>traditional</i> ballad.</p>

<p><a name="Linenote_3_38" id="Linenote_3_38"></a><a href="#LNanchor_3_38" title="link to line number">38</a>. Thomas Boyd, Earl of Arran, was forfeited, with his
father and uncle, in 1469, for an attempt on the person of
James III. He had a son, James, who was restored, and in
favor with James IV. about 1482.   If this be the person here
meant, we should read, "The Earl of Arran his <i>son</i> was he."
Glenriddel's copy reads, "a Highland laird I'm sure was he."
Reciters sometimes call the messenger the Laird of Skene.&mdash;S.</p>

steep descent on the south side of Minch-moor, which
separates Tweeddale from Ettrick Forest; and from the top
of which we have the first view of the woods of Hangingshaw,
the Castle of Newark, and the romantic dale of
Yarrow.&mdash;S.</p>

<p><a name="Linenote_3_173" id="Linenote_3_173"></a><a href="#LNanchor_3_173" title="link to line number">173</a>. This family were ancestors of the Murrays, Earls of
Annandale; but the name of the representative, in the time
of James IV., was William, not Andrew. Glenriddel's MS.
reads, "the country-keeper."&mdash;S.</p>

<p><a name="Linenote_3_183" id="Linenote_3_183"></a><a href="#LNanchor_3_183" title="link to line number">183</a>. Before the Barony of Traquair became the property of
the Stewarts, it belonged to a family of Murrays, afterwards
Murrays of Black-barony, and ancestors of Lord Elibank.
The old castle was situated on the Tweed. The lands of
Traquair were forfeited by Willielmus de Moravia, previous
to 1464; for, in that year, a charter, proceeding upon his forfeiture,
was granted by the crown to "Willielmo Douglas de
Cluny." Sir James was, perhaps, the heir of William
Murray. It would farther seem, that the grant in 1464 was
not made effectual by Douglas; for another charter from the
crown, dated the 3d February, 1478, conveys the estate of
Traquair to James Stewart, Earl of Buchan, son of the Black
Knight of Lorne, and maternal uncle to James III., from
whom is descended the present Earl of Traquair. The first
royal grant not being followed by possession, it is very possible
that the Murrays may have continued to occupy Traquair
long after the date of that charter. Hence, Sir James
might have reason to say, as in the ballad, "The King has
gifted my lands lang syne."&mdash;S.</p>

of a high ridge of hills, dividing the vales of Tweed and
Yarrow, a little to the eastward of Minch-moor. It is the
outermost point of the lands of Broadmeadows. The Glenriddel
MS., which, in this instance, is extremely inaccurate
as to names, calls the place of rendezvous, "<i>The Poor
Man's House</i>," and hints that the Outlaw was surprised by
the treachery of the King:&mdash;</p>

<span class="i0">For to fetch me here frae amang my men,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Here, like a dog for to die.'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>I believe the reader will think with me, that the catastrophe
is better, as now printed from Mrs. Cockburn's copy.
The deceit, supposed to be practised on the Outlaw, is unworthy
of the military monarch, as he is painted in the
ballad; especially if we admit him to be King James IV.&mdash;S.</p>

<p><a name="Linenote_3_312" id="Linenote_3_312"></a><a href="#LNanchor_3_312" title="link to line number">312</a>. In this and the following verse, the ceremony of feudal
investiture is supposed to be gone through, by the Outlaw
resigning his possessions into the hands of the king, and
receiving them back, to be held of him as superior. The
lands of Philiphaugh are still possessed by the Outlaw's representative.
Hangingshaw and Lewinshope were sold of
late years. Newark, Foulshiels, and Tinnies, have long
belonged to the family of Buccleuch.&mdash;S.</p>

<h3><a name="JOHNIE_ARMSTRANG" id="JOHNIE_ARMSTRANG"></a>JOHNIE ARMSTRANG.</h3>


<p>"Johnie Armstrong, of Gilnockie, the hero of
the following ballad, is a noted personage, both in
history and tradition. He was, it would seem from
the ballad, a brother of the Laird of Mangertoun,
chief of the name. His place of residence (now a
roofless tower) was at the Hollows, a few miles from
Langholm, where its ruins still serve to adorn a scene,
which, in natural beauty, has few equals in Scotland.
At the head of a desperate band of freebooters, this
Armstrong is said to have spread the terror of his<!-- Page 38 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
name almost as far as Newcastle, and to have levied
black-mail, or protection and forbearance money, for
many miles round. James V., of whom it was long
remembered by his grateful people that he made the
"rush-bush keep the cow," about 1529, undertook an
expedition through the Border counties, to suppress
the turbulent spirit of the Marchmen. But before
setting out upon his journey, he took the precaution
of imprisoning the different Border chieftains, who
were the chief protectors of the marauders. The
Earl of Bothwell was forfeited, and confined in Edinburgh
Castle. The Lords of Home and Maxwell, the
Lairds of Buccleuch, Fairniherst, and Johnston, with
many others, were also committed to ward. Cockburn
of Henderland, and Adam Scott of Tushielaw,
called the King of the Border, were publicly executed.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Lesley</span>,
p. 430. The King then marched rapidly
forward, at the head of a flying army of ten thousand
men, through Ettrick Forest and Ewsdale. The evil
genius of our Johnie Armstrong, or, as others say, the
private advice of some courtiers, prompted him to
present himself before James, at the head of thirty-six
horse, arrayed in all the pomp of Border chivalry.
Pitscottie uses nearly the words of the ballad, in describing
the splendor of his equipment, and his high
expectations of favor from the King. "But James,
looking upon him sternly, said to his attendants,
'What wants that knave that a king should have?'
and ordered him and his followers to instant execution."&mdash;"But
John Armstrong," continues this minute
historian, "made great offers to the King: That he
should sustain himself, with forty gentlemen, ever
ready at his service, on their own cost, without wrong<!-- Page 39 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>ing
any Scottishman: Secondly, that there was not a
subject in England, duke, earl, or baron, but, within a
certain day, he should bring him to his majesty, either
quick or dead. At length, he seeing no hope of
favor, said very proudly, 'It is folly to seek grace at
a graceless face; but,' said he, 'had I known this, I
should have lived upon the Borders in despite of King
Harry and you both; for I know King Harry would
<i>downweigh my best horse with gold</i>, to know that I were
condemned to die this day."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Pitscottie's</span> <i>History</i>,
p. 145. Johnie and all his retinue were accordingly
hanged upon growing trees, at a place called Carlenrig
Chapel, about ten miles above Hawick, on the
high road to Langholm. The country people believe,
that, to manifest the injustice of the execution, the
trees withered away. Armstrong and his followers
were buried in a deserted churchyard, where their
graves are still shown.</p>

<p>"As this Border hero was a person of great note in
his way, he is frequently alluded to by the writers of
the time. Sir David Lindsay of the Mount, in the
curious play published by Mr. Pinkerton, from the
Bannatyne MS., introduces a pardoner, or knavish
dealer in relics, who produces, among his holy rarities&mdash;</p>

<p>The ballad as here given is to be found in <i>A Collection

whole title is: <i>Johnny Armstrang's Last Good-night,
shewing how John Armstrong, with his eightscore men,
fought a bloody battle with the Scotch King at Edenborough</i>.
It had previously appeared in <i>Wit Restor'd</i>,
1658, p. 123, in very good shape, except the want of
some stanzas towards the end. It is in this form, says
Motherwell, that the story is preserved in the mouths
of the people. Nevertheless, Allan Ramsay has inserted
in his <i>Evergreen</i> quite a different version,
taken down from the mouth of a gentleman of the
name of Armstrong, "the sixth generation from this
John," which the reciter maintained to be the genuine
ballad, "and the common one false."</p>

<p>The following verses, generally styled <i>Armstrong's
Good-night</i>, are said to have been composed by one of
that tribe who was executed in 1601 for the murder
of Sir John Carmichael, Warden of the Middle
Marches. They are from Johnson's <i>Museum</i>, p. 620,
and are also found in Herd's <i>Scottish Songs</i>, ii. 182.
In Buchan's <i>Ballads of the North of Scotland</i>, ii. 127,

<h3><a name="HUGHIE_GRAHAM" id="HUGHIE_GRAHAM"></a>HUGHIE GRAHAM.</h3>


<p>Of the two editions of this ballad which follow, the
first is taken from <i>The Scots Musical Museum</i> (p.
312), to which it was contributed by Burns. Burns
states that he obtained his copy from oral tradition
in Ayrshire, but he had certainly retouched several
stanzas (the ninth and tenth, says Cromek), and the
third and eighth are entirely of his composition.</p>

<p>The other copy is from the <i>Border Minstrelsy</i>, and
consists of a version "long current in Selkirkshire"
(procured for Scott by Mr. William Laidlaw), which
also has been slightly improved by the pen of the
editor.</p>

<p><a href="#THE_LIFE_AND_DEATH_OF_SIR_HUGH_OF">In the Appendix</a> we have placed the story as it
occurs in Durfey's <i>Pills to purge Melancholy</i>, and in
Ritson's <i>Ancient Songs</i>. The seventeenth volume of
the Percy Society Publications furnishes us with a
Scottish version in which Sir Hugh is rescued and
sent over the sea: <i>Scottish Traditional Versions of
Ancient Ballads</i>, p. 73. These, we believe, are all
the published forms of this ballad, unless we mention
Mr. Allan Cunningham's <i>réchauffé</i> of Burns, in his
<i>Songs of Scotland</i>, i. 327.</p>

<p>"According to <i>tradition</i>," says Mr. Stenhouse,
"Robert Aldridge, Bishop of Carlisle, about the year
1560, seduced the wife of Hugh Graham, one of those
bold and predatory chiefs who so long inhabited what
was called the Debatable Land, on the English and<!-- Page 52 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
Scottish border. Graham, being unable to bring so
powerful a prelate to justice, in revenge made an
excursion into Cumberland, and carried off <i>inter alia</i>,
a fine mare belonging to the bishop (!) but being
closely pursued by Sir John Scroope, warden of
Carlisle, with a party on horseback, was apprehended
near Solway Moss, and carried to Carlisle, where he
was tried and convicted of felony. Great intercessions
were made to save his life; but the bishop, it is
said, being determined to remove the chief obstacle
to his guilty passions, remained inexorable, and poor
Graham fell a victim to his own indiscretion and his
wife's infidelity. Anthony Wood observes that there
were many changes in this prelate's time, both in
church and state, but that he retained his offices and

<h3><a name="KINMONT_WILLIE" id="KINMONT_WILLIE"></a>KINMONT WILLIE.</h3>


<p>In the year 1596, Mr. Salkeld, the deputy of Lord
Scroope, the English warden of the West Marches,
and Robert Scott, the representative of the Laird of
Buccleuch, then keeper of Liddesdale, held a meeting
on the border line of the kingdoms, according to the
custom of the times, for the purpose of arranging such
differences, and redressing such grievances, as either
party might have to allege. On these occasions a
truce was always proclaimed, inviolable on pain of
death, from the day of the meeting to the next day at
sunrise. After the conference in question, as William
Armstrong of Kinmonth, a notorious freebooter, whose
ordinary style was Kinmont Willie, was returning to
his home, accompanied by only three or four persons,
he was pursued by a couple of hundred Englishmen,
taken prisoner, and in contravention of the truce,
lodged in the castle of Carlisle. The Laird of Buccleuch
sought to obtain the enfranchisement of his
client and retainer, through the mediation, first of the
English warden, and then of the Scottish ambassador.
Receiving no satisfaction, he took the matter into his
own hands, raised a party of two hundred horse,
surprised the castle of Carlisle, and carried off the
prisoner by main force. This dashing achievement
was performed on the 13th of April, 1596.</p>

<p>According to a rhymester who celebrated the daring
feat of Buccleuch about a hundred years later, Kinmont
Willie was a descendant of Johnie Armstrong
of Gilnockie.<!-- Page 59 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>

<p>Interesting details of the surprise of the castle, and
further notices of Kinmont Willie are given by Scott
in the <i>Border Minstrelsy</i> (ii. 32), where the ballad
was first published.</p>

<p>"This ballad is preserved," says Scott, "on the
West Borders, but much mangled by reciters, so that
some conjectural emendations have been absolutely
necessary to render it intelligible."</p>

<h3><a name="DICK_O_THE_COW" id="DICK_O_THE_COW"></a>DICK O' THE COW.</h3>

<p class="center">From Caw's <i>Poetical Museum</i>, p. 22.</p>


<p>The personage from whom this ballad is named
was jester to Lord Scroop, who was warden of the
West Marches of England from 1590 to 1603. The
Laird's Jock, that is John, the son of the Laird of
Mangerton, "appears as one of the <i>men of name</i> in
Liddesdale, in the list of the Border Clans, 1597."</p>

<p><i>Dick o' the Cow</i> is closely connected with <i><a href="#JOCK_O_THE_SIDE">Jock o'
the Side</a></i> and <i><a href="#HOBIE_NOBLE">Hobie Noble</a></i>, which follow shortly after.
All three were first printed in Caw's <i>Museum</i>, and
seem to have been contributed by a Mr. Elliot, a
Liddesdale gentleman, to whom Sir W. Scott acknowledges
many obligations. We are told that both <i>Dick
o' the Cow</i> and <i>Jock o' the Side</i> were until lately so
popular in Liddesdale with all classes of people, that
they were invariably sung, from beginning to end, at
every festive meeting.</p>

<p>The ballad of <i>Dick o' the Cow</i> was well known in
England as early as 1596.<!-- Page 68 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>

<p>"An allusion to it likewise occurs in <span class="smcap">Parrot's</span>
<i>Laquei Ridiculosi</i>, or <i>Springes for Woodcocks</i>; London,
1613.</p>

his brother Willie, and the Laird's Jock&mdash;of which Dickie
carried off two, and left that of the Laird's Jock, probably

seems but indifferently founded; for, in July, 1586, a bill
was fouled against him, Dick of Dryup, and others, by the
Deputy of Bewcastle, at a warden-meeting, for 400 head
of cattle taken in open foray from the Drysike in Bewcastle:
and in September, 1587, another complaint appears at the
instance of one Andrew Rutlege of the Nook, against the
Laird's Jock, and his accomplices, for 50 kine and oxen,
besides furniture, to the amount of 100 merks sterling. See
Bell's MSS., as quoted in the <i>History of Cumberland and

<p class="center">From Caw's <i>Poetical Museum</i>, p. 145.</p>


<p>The rescue of a prisoner from the hands of justice
was a very favourite subject with ballad-makers, and,
it is to be feared, no uncommon event in the actual
experience of the police of former days. We have in
the fifth volume seen how such an affair was conducted<!-- Page 81 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
by Robin Hood and his associates; and in <i><a href="#KINMONT_WILLIE">Kinmont
Willie</a></i> have had an authenticated account of a remarkable
exploit of this description at the close of
the reign of Elizabeth. The two ballads which follow
have this same theme; but only the authority of tradition.
<i>Jock o' the Side</i> has one circumstance in common
with <i>Kinmont Willie</i>&mdash;the daring passage of the
river: with <i><a href="#ARCHIE_OF_CAFIELD">Archie of Ca'field</a></i> it agrees throughout.</p>

<p>Jock o' the Side would seem to have been nephew
to the Laird of Mangertoun (the chief of the clan
Armstrong), and consequently cousin to the Laird's
Jock. Scott suggests that he was probably brother to
Christie of the Syde, mentioned in the list of Border
clans, 1597. Both of these worthies receive special
notice in Maitland's complaint <i>Against the Thieves of
Liddisdale</i>.</p>

with the Earl of Northumberland, in the
twelfth year of Elizabeth.</p>

<p>"We have seen the hero of this ballad act a distinguished
part in the deliverance of Jock o' the Side,
and are now to learn the ungrateful return which the
Armstrongs made him for his faithful services. Hal<!-- Page 98 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>bert,
or Hobbie, Noble appears to have been one of
those numerous English outlaws, who, being forced to
fly their own country, had established themselves on
the Scottish Borders. As Hobbie continued his depredations
upon the English, they bribed some of his
hosts, the Armstrongs, to decoy him into England
under pretence of a predatory expedition. He was
there delivered, by his treacherous companions, into
the hands of the officers of justice, by whom he was
conducted to Carlisle, and executed next morning.
The Laird of Mangertoun, with whom Hobbie was in
high favour, is said to have taken a severe revenge
upon the traitors who betrayed him. The principal
contriver of the scheme, called here Sim o' the
Maynes, fled into England from the resentment of his
chief; but experienced there the common fate of a
traitor, being himself executed at Carlisle, about two
months after Hobbie's death. Such is, at least, the
tradition of Liddesdale. Sim o' the Maynes appears
among the Armstrongs of Whitauch, in Liddesdale,
in the list of Clans so often alluded to."&mdash;<i>Minstrelsy
of the Scottish Border</i>, ii. 90.</p>

be a large and rather wild manorial district in the extreme
southwest part of Northumberland; the proprietor of which
might be naturally called the Lord, though not <i>Earl</i> of Whitfield.
I suspect, however, that the reciters may have corrupted
the <i>great</i> Ralph Whitfield into Earl of Whitfield.
Sir Matthew Whitfield of Whitfield, was Sheriff of Northumberland
in 1433, and the estate continued in the family from
the reign of Richard II. till about fifty years since.&mdash;S.</p>

<p>"There is another ballad, under the same title as
the following, in which nearly the same incidents
are narrated, with little difference, except that the
honour of rescuing the cattle is attributed to the Liddesdale
Elliots, headed by a chief, there called Martin
Elliot of the Preakin Tower, whose son, Simon, is
said to have fallen in the action. It is very possible,
that both the Teviotdale Scotts, and the Elliots, were
engaged in the affair, and that each claimed the
honour of the victory.</p>

<p>"The Editor presumes, that the Willie Scott, here<!-- Page 106 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>

<h3><a name="THE_FRAY_OF_SUPORT" id="THE_FRAY_OF_SUPORT"></a>THE FRAY OF SUPORT.</h3>

<p class="center">From <i>Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border</i>, ii. 124.</p>


<p>"Of all the Border ditties which have fallen into
the Editor's hands, this is by far the most uncouth and
savage. It is usually chanted in a sort of wild recitative,
except the burden, which swells into a long and
varied howl, not unlike to a view hollo'. The words,
and the very great irregularity of the stanza (if it deserves
the name) sufficiently point out its intention
and origin. An English woman, residing in Suport,
near the foot of the Kers-hope, having been plundered
in the night by a band of the Scottish moss-troopers,
is supposed to convoke her servants and friends for
the pursuit, or <i>Hot Trod</i>; upbraiding them, at the<!-- Page 116 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
same time, in homely phrase, for their negligence and
security. The <i>Hot Trod</i> was followed by the persons
who had lost goods, with blood-hounds and horns, to
raise the country to help. They also used to carry a
burning wisp of straw at a spear head, and to raise a
cry, similar to the Indian war-whoop. It appears, from
articles made by the Wardens of the English Marches,
September 12th, in 6th of Edward VI., that all, on
this cry being raised, were obliged to follow the fray,
or chase, under pain of death. With these explanations,
the general purport of the ballad may be easily
discovered, though particular passages have become
inexplicable, probably through corruptions introduced
by reciters. The present text is collected from four
copies, which differed widely from each other."&mdash;S.</p>

<h3><a name="ROOKHOPE_RYDE" id="ROOKHOPE_RYDE"></a>ROOKHOPE RYDE.</h3>


<p>"A Bishopric Border song, composed in 1569,
taken down from the chanting of George Collingwood
the elder, late of Boltsburn, in the neighbourhood
of Ryhope, who was interred at Stanhope, the 16th
December, 1785.</p>

<p>"Rookhope is the name of a valley about five miles
in length; at the termination of which, Rookhope burn
empties itself into the river Wear, and is in the
north part of the parish of Stanhope, in Weardale.
Rookhope-head is the top of the vale."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ritson.</span></p>

<p>The date of the event, says Sir W. Scott, is precisely
ascertained to be (not 1569 but) the 6th of
December, 1572, when the Tynedale robbers were
encouraged to make a foray into Weardale in consequence
of the confusion occasioned by the rebellion
of Westmoreland and Northumberland.</p>

historian, to be a name given to the Picts' or Roman wall,
from its having been thirled, or perforated, in ancient times,
by the Scots and Picts.</p>

<p>Willie-haver, or Willeva, is a small district or township in

and Charles Nevil, Earl of Westmoreland, who, on
the 15th of November, 1569, at the head of their tenantry
and others, took arms for the purpose of liberating Mary,
Queen of Scots, and restoring the old religion. They besieged
Barnard castle, which was, for eleven days, stoutly defended
by Sir George Bowes, who, afterward, being appointed the
Queen's marshal, hanged the poor constables and peasantry
by dozens in a day, to the amount of 800. The Earl of
Northumberland, betrayed by the Scots, with whom he had
taken refuge, was beheaded at York, on the 22d of August,
1572; and the Earl of Westmoreland, deprived of the ancient
and noble patrimony of the Nevils, and reduced to beggary,
escaped over sea, into Flanders, and died in misery and disgrace,
being the last of his family.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ritson</span>. See <i>The Rising

of Weardale, and of Forster, &amp;c., under successive prelates.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Surtees.</span></p>

<p class="center">From <i>Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border</i>, ii. 15.</p>


<p>This ballad is preserved in the Bannatyne MS.,
and was first printed in Ramsay's <i>Evergreen</i>, ii. 224.
Scott informs us that Ramsay took some liberties with
the original text, and even interpolated the manuscript
to favor his readings. A more accurate copy was
given in the <i>Border Minstrelsy</i>. The text in Herd's<!-- Page 130 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
<i>Scottish Songs</i>, i. 91, and Caw's <i>Museum</i>, p. 235, is
that of the <i>Evergreen</i>.</p>

<p>"The skirmish of the Reidswire happened upon
the 7th of June, 1575, at one of the meetings held by
the Wardens of the Marches, for arrangements necessary
upon the Border. Sir John Carmichael was
the Scottish Warden, and Sir John Forster held that
office on the English Middle March. In the course
of the day, which was employed as usual in redressing
wrongs, a bill, or indictment, at the instance of a
Scottish complainer, was fouled (<i>i. e.</i> found a true bill)
against one Farnstein, a notorious English freebooter.
Forster alleged that he had fled from justice. Carmichael,
considering this as a pretext to avoid making
compensation for the felony, bade him "play fair!"
to which the haughty English warden retorted, by
some injurious expressions respecting Carmichael's
family, and gave other open signs of resentment.
His retinue, chiefly men of Redesdale and Tynedale,
the most ferocious of the English Borderers, glad of
any pretext for a quarrel, discharged a flight of arrows
among the Scots. A warm conflict ensued, in
which, Carmichael being beat down and made prisoner,
success seemed at first to incline to the English
side, till the Tynedale men, throwing themselves too
greedily upon the plunder, fell into disorder; and a
body of Jedburgh citizens arriving at that instant, the
skirmish terminated in a complete victory on the part
of the Scots, who took prisoners, the English warden,
James Ogle, Cuthbert Collingwood, Francis Russell,
son to the Earl of Bedford, and son-in-law to Forster,
some of the Fenwicks, and several other Border chiefs.
They were sent to the Earl of Morton, then Regent,
who detained them at Dalkeith for some days, till the<!-- Page 131 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
heat of their resentment was abated; which prudent
precaution prevented a war betwixt the two kingdoms.
He then dismissed them with great expressions
of regard; and, to satisfy Queen Elizabeth, sent Carmichael
to York, whence he was soon after honourably
dismissed. The field of battle, called the Reidswire,
is a part of the Carter Mountain, about ten miles
from Jedburgh."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Scott.</span></p>

of people, was termed <i>slogan</i> or <i>slughorn</i>, and was always
repeated at an onset, as well as on many other occasions.
It was usually the name of the clan, or place of rendezvous,
or leader. In 1335, the English, led by Thomas of Rosslyne,
and William Moubray, assaulted Aberdeen. The former
was mortally wounded in the onset; and, as his followers
were pressing forward, shouting "<i>Rosslyne! Rosslyne!</i>"

<h3><a name="THE_DEATH_OF_PARCY_REED" id="THE_DEATH_OF_PARCY_REED"></a>THE DEATH OF PARCY REED.</h3>


<p>Taken down from the recitation of an old woman,
and first published (certainly not without what are
called "improvements") in Richardson's <i>Borderer's
Table Book</i>, vol. vii. p. 364, with an introduction by
Mr. Robert White, which we here abridge.</p>

<p>Percival or Parcy Reed, was proprietor of Troughend,
a tract of land in Redesdale, Northumberland,
a man of courage and devoted to the chase. Having
been appointed warden of the district, he had the
misfortune in the discharge of his duties, to offend a
family of the name of Hall, who were owners of the
farm of Girsonsfield, and also to incur the enmity of
a band of moss-troopers, Crosier by name, some of
whom had been brought to justice by his hands. The
Halls concealed their resentment until they were able
to contrive an opportunity for taking a safe revenge.<!-- Page 140 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
In pursuance of this design, they requested Reed to
join them on a hunting party. Their invitation was
unsuspiciously accepted, and after a day of sport the
company retired to a solitary hut in the lonely glen
of Batinghope. Here Reed was attacked in the evening
by the Crosiers, and as the Halls not only
refused their assistance, but had treacherously deprived
him of the means of defence by rendering his
sword and gun unserviceable, he fell an easy victim
to his savage foes.</p>

<p>It is probable that we cannot assign to the event on
which this piece is founded, a date later than the
sixteenth century.</p>

<p>The story of Parcy Reed is alluded to in <i>Rokeby</i>,
canto first, <span class="smcap">xx.</span>; Sir Walter Scott has also taken the
death of his dog Keeldar as the subject of a poem
contributed to Hood's annual, <i>The Gem</i>, for 1829.</p>

<h3><a name="CAPTAIN_CAR_OR_EDOM_O_GORDON" id="CAPTAIN_CAR_OR_EDOM_O_GORDON"></a>CAPTAIN CAR, OR, EDOM O' GORDON.</h3>


<p>"This ballad is founded upon a real event, which
took place in the north of Scotland in the year 1571,
during the struggles between the party which held out
for the imprisoned Queen Mary, and that which endeavoured
to maintain the authority of her infant son,
James VI. The person designated Edom o' Gordon
was Adam Gordon of Auchindown, brother of the
Marquis of Huntly, and his deputy as lieutenant of
the north of Scotland for the Queen. This gentleman
committed many acts of oppression on the clan
Forbes, under colour of the Queen's authority, and in
one collision with that family, killed Arthur, brother<!-- Page 148 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
to Lord Forbes. He afterwards sent a party under
one Captain Car, or Ker, to reduce the house of
Towie, one of the chief seats of the name of Forbes.
The proprietor of the mansion being from home, his
lady, who was pregnant at the time, confiding too much
in her sex and condition, not only refused to surrender,
but gave Car some very opprobrious language over
the walls, which irritated him so much that he set fire
to the house, and burnt the whole inmates, amounting
in all to thirty-seven persons. As Gordon never
cashiered Car for this inhuman action, he was held by
the public voice to be equally guilty, and accordingly
[in one of the versions of the ballad] he is represented
as the principal actor himself." (<span class="smcap">Chambers</span>'s
<i>Scottish Ballads</i>, p. 67.) It appears that the Forbeses
afterwards attempted to assassinate Adam Gordon in
the streets of Paris. See more of this Captain
Ker under <i>The Battell of Balrinnes</i>, in the next
volume.</p>

<p>The ballad was first printed by the Foulises at
Glasgow, 1755, under the title of <i>Edom of Gordon</i>,
as taken down by Sir David Dalrymple from the recitation
of a lady. It was inserted in the <i>Reliques</i>,
(i. 122,) "improved and enlarged," (or, as Ritson
more correctly expresses the fact, "interpolated and
corrupted,") by several stanzas from a fragment in
Percy's manuscript, called <i>Captain Adam Carre</i>.
Ritson published the following genuine and ancient
copy, (<i>Ancient Songs</i>, ii. 38,) from a collection in the
Cotton Library. He states that his MS. had received
numerous alterations or corrections, all or most of
which, as being evidently for the better, he had
adopted into the text. We have added a copy of<!-- Page 149 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
<a href="#EDOM_O_GORDON"><i>Edom o' Gordon</i></a> given in Ritson's <i>Scottish Songs</i>, and
in the Appendix an inferior version of the story,
called <a href="#LOUDOUN_CASTLE_See_p_149"><i>Loudoun Castle</i></a>.</p>

<p>The names vary considerably in the different versions
of this piece. The castle of Towie, or the house
of Rothes, is here called the castle of Crecrynbroghe,
in Percy's manuscript the castle of Brittonsborrow,
and in the copy in the Appendix the locality is changed
to Loudoun castle in Ayrshire. In like manner, Alexander
Forbes is here turned into Lord Hamleton, and
Captain Car is now called the lord of Easter-town
and again the lord of Westerton-town.</p>

<p>In the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i>, vol. xci. Part 1,
p. 451, will be found a modern ballad styled <i>Adam
Gordon</i>, founded on the adventure of the freebooter
of that name with Edward the First. Another on the
same subject is given in Evans's <i>Old Ballads</i>, iv. 86.</p>

<p>These fragments appear to relate to the burning
of Auchindown, a castle belonging to the Gordons,
in vengeance for the death of William Mackintosh of
the clan Chattan, which is said to have occurred at
the castle of the Earl of Huntly. The event is placed
in the year 1592. After the Mackintoshes had executed
their revenge, they were pursued by the Gordons,
and overtaken in the Stapler, where "sixty of
the clan Chattan were killed, and Willie Mackintosh,<!-- Page 160 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>

<h3><a name="LORD_MAXWELLS_GOODNIGHT" id="LORD_MAXWELLS_GOODNIGHT"></a>LORD MAXWELL'S GOODNIGHT.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border</i>, ii. 199.</p>


<p>"A. D. 1585, John Lord Maxwell, or, as he styled
himself, Earl of Morton, having quarrelled with the
Earl of Arran, reigning favourite of James VI., and
fallen, of course, under the displeasure of the court,
was denounced rebel. A commission was also given
to the Laird of Johnstone, then Warden of the West
Marches, to pursue and apprehend the ancient rival
and enemy of his house. Two bands of mercenaries,
commanded by Captains Cranstoun and Lammie, who
were sent from Edinburgh to support Johnstone, were
attacked and cut to pieces at Crawford-muir, by
Robert Maxwell, natural brother to the chieftain;
who, following up his advantage, burned Johnstone's<!-- Page 163 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
Castle of Lochwood, observing, with savage glee, that
he would give Lady Johnstone light enough by which
'to set her hood.' In a subsequent conflict, Johnstone
himself was defeated, and made prisoner, and is
said to have died of grief at the disgrace which he
sustained.</p>

<p>"By one of the revolutions, common in those days,
Maxwell was soon after restored to the King's favour
in his turn, and obtained the wardenry of the West
Marches. A bond of alliance was subscribed by him,
and by Sir James Johnstone, and for some time the
two clans lived in harmony. In the year 1593, however,
the hereditary feud was revived on the following
occasion. A band of marauders, of the clan Johnstone,
drove a prey of cattle from the lands belonging
to the Lairds of Crichton, Sanquhar, and Drumlanrig;
and defeated, with slaughter, the pursuers, who attempted
to rescue their property.&mdash;[See <a href="#THE_LADS_OF_WAMPHRAY"><i>The Lads of
Wamphray</i></a>, post, p. 168.] The injured parties, being
apprehensive that Maxwell would not cordially embrace
their cause, on account of his late reconciliation
with the Johnstones, endeavoured to overcome his
reluctance, by offering to enter into bonds of manrent,
and so to become his followers and liegemen; he, on
the other hand, granting to them a bond of maintenance,
or protection, by which he bound himself, in
usual form, to maintain their quarrel against all mortals,
saving his loyalty. Thus, the most powerful and
respectable families in Dumfriesshire, became, for a
time, the vassals of Lord Maxwell. This secret alliance
was discovered to Sir James Johnstone by the
Laird of Cummertrees, one of his own clan, though a
retainer to Maxwell. Cummertrees even contrived<!-- Page 164 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
to possess himself of the bonds of manrent, which he
delivered to his chief. The petty warfare betwixt the
rival barons was instantly renewed. Buccleuch, a
near relation of Johnstone, came to his assistance
with his clan, 'the most renowned freebooters, [says
a historian,] the fiercest and bravest warriors among
the Border tribes.' With Buccleuch also came the
Elliots, Armstrongs, and Græmes. Thus reinforced,
Johnstone surprised and cut to pieces a party of the
Maxwells, stationed at Lochmaben. On the other
hand, Lord Maxwell, armed with the royal authority,
and numbering among his followers all the barons of
Nithsdale, displayed his banner as the King's lieutenant,
and invaded Annandale at the head of two
thousand men. In those days, however, the royal
auspices seem to have carried as little good fortune as
effective strength with them. A desperate conflict,
still renowned in tradition, took place at the Dryffe
Sands, not far from Lockerby, in which Johnstone,
although inferior in numbers, partly by his own conduct,
partly by the valour of his allies, gained a decisive
victory. Lord Maxwell, a tall man, and heavily
armed, was struck from his horse in the flight, and
cruelly slain, after the hand, which he stretched out
for quarter, had been severed from his body. Many
of his followers were slain in the battle, and many
cruelly wounded, especially by slashes in the face,
which wound was thence termed a 'Lockerby lick.'
The Barons of Lag, Closeburn, and Drumlanrig,
escaped by the fleetness of their horses; a circumstance
alluded to in the following ballad.</p>

<p>"John, Lord Maxwell, with whose 'Goodnight' the
reader is here presented, was son to him who fell at<!-- Page 165 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
the battle of Dryffe Sands, and is said to have early
avowed the deepest revenge for his father's death.
Such, indeed, was the fiery and untameable spirit of
the man, that neither the threats nor entreaties of the
King himself could make him lay aside his vindictive
purpose; although Johnstone, the object of his resentment,
had not only reconciled himself to the court,
but even obtained the wardenry of the Middle
Marches, in room of Sir John Carmichael, murdered
by the Armstrongs. Lord Maxwell was therefore
prohibited to approach the Border counties; and having,
in contempt of that mandate, excited new disturbances,
he was confined in the castle of Edinburgh.
From this fortress, however, he contrived to make his
escape; and, having repaired to Dumfriesshire, he
sought an amicable interview with Johnstone, under
a pretence of a wish to accommodate their differences.
Sir Robert Maxwell, of Orchardstane, (mentioned in
the ballad, verse 1,) who was married to a sister of
Sir James Johnstone, persuaded his brother-in-law to
accede to Maxwell's proposal."</p>

<p>So far Sir Walter Scott. The meeting took place
on the 6th of April, 1608, in the presence of Sir
Robert Maxwell, each party being accompanied by a
single follower. While the chieftains were conferring
together, Charles Maxwell, the attendant of Lord
John, maliciously began an altercation with the servant
of Johnstone, and shot him with a pistol, and Sir
James, looking round at the report, was himself shot
by Lord Maxwell in the back with two poisoned
bullets.</p>

<p>The murderer escaped to France, but afterwards
venturing to return to Scotland, was apprehended,<!-- Page 166 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
brought to trial at Edinburgh, and beheaded on the
21st of May, 1613. We may naturally suppose that
the <i>Goodnight</i> was composed shortly after Lord Maxwell
fled across the seas, certainly before 1613.</p>

<p>This ballad was first printed in the <i>Border Minstrelsy</i>
"from a copy in Glenriddel's MSS., with some
slight variations from tradition."</p>

<h3><a name="THE_LADS_OF_WAMPHRAY" id="THE_LADS_OF_WAMPHRAY"></a>THE LADS OF WAMPHRAY</h3>

<p class="center"><i>Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border</i>, ii. 148.</p>


<p>"The reader will find, prefixed to the foregoing
ballad, an account of the noted feud betwixt the
families of Maxwell and Johnstone. The following
song celebrates the skirmish, in 1593, betwixt the
Johnstones and Crichtons, which led to the revival of
the ancient quarrel betwixt Johnstone and Maxwell,
and finally to the battle of Dryffe Sands, in which<!-- Page 169 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
the latter lost his life. Wamphray is the name of a
parish in Annandale. Lethenhall was the abode of
Johnstone of Wamphray, and continued to be so till
of late years. William Johnstone of Wamphray,
called the Galliard, was a noted freebooter. A place,
near the head of Teviotdale, retains the name of the
Galliard's Faulds, (folds,) being a valley, where he
used to secrete and divide his spoil, with his Liddesdale
and Eskdale associates. His <i>nom de guerre</i> seems
to have been derived from the dance called the Galliard.
The word is still used in Scotland, to express
an active, gay, dissipated character. Willie of the
Kirkhill, nephew to the Galliard, and his avenger,
was also a noted Border robber. Previous to the
battle of Dryffe Sands, so often mentioned, tradition
reports, that Maxwell had offered a ten-pound-land to
any of his party, who should bring him the head or
hand of the Laird of Johnstone. This being reported
to his antagonist, he answered, he had not a ten-pound-land
to offer, but would give a five-merk-land to the
man who should that day cut off the head or hand of
Lord Maxwell. Willie of the Kirkhill, mounted upon
a young grey horse, rushed upon the enemy, and
earned the reward, by striking down their unfortunate
chieftain, and cutting off his right hand."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Scott.</span></p>

<h3><a name="THE_FIRE_OF_FRENDRAUGHT" id="THE_FIRE_OF_FRENDRAUGHT"></a>THE FIRE OF FRENDRAUGHT.</h3>

<p class="center">From Motherwell's <i>Minstrelsy</i>, p. 161.</p>


<p>"A mortal feud having arisen between the Laird
of Frendraught [Sir James Chrichton] and the Laird
of Rothiemay [William Gordon], both gentlemen of
Banffshire, a rencontre took place, at which the retainers
of both were present, on the 1st of January,
1630; when Rothiemay was killed, and several persons
hurt on both sides. To stanch this bloody quarrel,
the Marquis of Huntly, who was chief to both parties,
and who had therefore a right to act as arbiter between
them, ordered Frendraught to pay fifty thousand
merks to Rothiemay's widow. In the ensuing September,
Frendraught fell into another quarrel, in the
course of which James Lesly, son to Lesly of Pitcaple,
was shot through the arm. Soon after the last inci<!-- Page 174 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>dent,
Frendraught, having paid a visit to the Marquis
of Huntly at the Bog of Gight, the Laird of Pitcaple
came up with thirty armed men, to demand atonement
for the wound of his son. Huntly acted in this case
with great discretion. Without permitting the two
lairds to come to a conference, he endeavored to persuade
the complaining party that Frendraught was in
reality innocent of his son's wound; and, as Pitcaple
went away vowing vengeance, he sent Frendraught
home under a strong escort, which was commanded
by his son, the Viscount Aboyne, and by the young
Laird of Rothiemay, son to him whom Frendraught
had killed some months before. The party reached
Frendraught Castle without being attacked by Pitcaple;
when, Aboyne and Rothiemay offering to take
leave of Frendraught and his lady, in order to return
home, they were earnestly entreated by these individuals
to remain a night, and postpone their return
till to-morrow. Being with difficulty prevailed upon,
the young Viscount and Rothiemay were well entertained,
and after supper went cheerfully to bed. To
continue the narrative in the words of Spalding&mdash;"The
Viscount was laid in an bed in the Old Tower
going off the hall, and standing upon a vault, wherein
there was ane round hole, devised of old, just under
Aboyne's bed. Robert Gordon, his servitor, and
English Will, his page, were both laid in the same
chamber. The Laird of Rothiemay, with some servants
beside him, was laid in another chamber just
above Aboyne's chamber; and in another room above
that chamber, were laid George Chalmers of Noth,
and George Gordon, another of the Viscount's servants;
with them also was laid Captain Rolloch, then<!-- Page 175 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
in Frendraught's own company. All being thus at
rest, about midnight that dolorous tower took fire in
so sudden and furious a manner, yea, and in ane clap,
that the noble Viscount, the Laird of Rothiemay,
English Will, Colonel Wat, another of Aboyne's servants,
and other two, being six in number, were cruelly
burnt and tormented to the death, without help or relief;
the Laird of Frendraught, his lady, and haill household
looking on, without moving or stirring to deliver
them from the fury of this fearful fire, as was reported.
Robert Gordon, called Sutherland Gordon, being in
the Viscount's chamber, escaped this fire with the life.
George Chalmers and Captain Rolloch, being in the
third room, escaped this fire also, and, as was said,
Aboyne might have saved himself also if he would have
gone out of doors, which he would not do, but suddenly
ran up stairs to Rothiemay's chamber, and wakened
him to rise; and as he is awakening him, the timber
passage and lofting of the chamber hastily takes fire, so
that none of them could win down stairs again; so they
turned to a window looking to the close, where they
piteously cried many times, "Help! help! for God's
cause!" The Laird and Lady, with their servants,
all seeing and hearing the woeful crying, made no
help or manner of helping; which they perceiving,
cried oftentimes mercy at God's hands for their sins;
syne clasped in each other's arms, and cheerfully
suffered their martyrdom. Thus died this noble Viscount,
of singular expectation, Rothiemay, a brave
youth, and the rest, by this doleful fire, never enough
to be deplored, to the great grief and sorrow of their
kin, parents, and hail common people, especially to
the noble Marquis, who for his good will got this<!-- Page 176 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
reward. No man can express the dolour of him and
his lady, nor yet the grief of the Viscount's own dear
lady, when it came to her ears, which she kept to her
dying day, disdaining after the company of men all
her life-time, following the love of the turtle dove.</p>

<p>'It is reported that upon the morn after this woeful
fire, the Lady Frendraught, daughter to the Earl of
Sutherland, and near cousin to the Marquis, backed
in a white plaid, and riding on a small nag, having a
boy leading her horse, without any more in her company,
in this pitiful manner she came weeping and
mourning to the Bog, desiring entry to speak with my
lord; but this was refused; so she returned back to
her own house, the same gate she came, comfortless.'&mdash;<span class="smcap">Spalding's</span>
<i>History of the Troubles in Scotland</i>.</p>

<p>"Suspicion formed two theories regarding the cause
of the fire of Frendraught. The first was, that the
Laird had wilfully set fire to the tower, for the purpose
of destroying the young Laird of Rothiemay. The
other was, that it originated in the revengeful feelings
of the Laird of Pitcaple. In the first theory there
is extremely little probability. First, it could not
have been premeditated; because the circumstance
of Frendraught being accompanied home that day
by Aboyne and Rothiemay, was entirely accidental.
In the second place, there was no reason for Frendraught
being inclined to murder Rothiemay, except
that he grudged the payment of the fifty thousand
merks to his mother; while there was every reason
for his being inclined rather to befriend a youth whom
he had already injured by occasioning the death of
his father. In the third place, all Frendraught's
family papers, with much gold and silver, both in<!-- Page 177 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
money and plate, were consumed in the fire. And,
in the fourth place, it is extremely improbable that
any man of his rank should commit so deliberate and
so atrocious an act of villainy. On the other hand, it
seems by no means improbable that Pitcaple should
have caused fire to be set to his enemy's house; a
mode of reprisal which had been practised in the
same district of country, as we have already seen, by
a gentleman of only the preceding age. Pitcaple's
men, moreover, had been heard to declare an intention
of attempting some such enterprise against Frendraught;
as was proved on the trial of a gentleman
of the name of Meldrum, who was apprehended, condemned,
and executed, for his alleged accession to their
conspiracy."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Chambers's</span> <i>Scottish Ballads</i>, p. 85.</p>

<p>This ballad was first printed in the <i>North Countrie
Garland</i>, p. 4, and afterwards with a few slight corrections
in Motherwell's <i>Minstrelsy</i>, having in both
cases been furnished by Mr. C. K. Sharpe. The
tragic story was celebrated by one Arthur Johnston,
a contemporary scholar, in two Latin poems, the one
entitled, <i>Querela Sophiæ Hay, dominæ de Melgeine, de
morte mariti</i>, and the other, <i>De Johanne Gordonio,
Vicecomite de Melgeine, el Johanne Gordonio de
Rothemay, in arce Frendriaca combustis</i> (Finlay,
i. 67). In Herd's Collection (i. 199) is a modern
piece on the subject called <i>Frennet Hall</i>, in the
detestable style of the last century. This very feeble
production is also to be found in Ritson's <i>Scottish
Songs</i> (ii. 31), Johnson's <i>Museum</i>, and elsewhere.
But Ritson gives these few stanzas of an excellent
old ballad, as remembered by the Rev. Mr. Boyd, the
translator of Dante:<!-- Page 178 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span></p>

<h3><a name="THE_BONNIE_HOUSE_O_AIRLY" id="THE_BONNIE_HOUSE_O_AIRLY"></a>THE BONNIE HOUSE O' AIRLY.</h3>

<p class="center">Finlay's <i>Scottish Ballads</i>, ii. 31.</p>


<p>The Earl of Airly, a nobleman zealously attached
to the cause of King Charles, withdrew from Scotland
in order to avoid subscribing the Covenant, leaving
his eldest son Lord Ogilvie at home. The Committee
of Estates, hearing that Airly had fled the country,
directed the Earls of Montrose and Kinghorn to take
possession of his castle, but in this, owing to the exceeding
strength of the place, they did not succeed.
Subsequently the Earl of Argyle, a personal enemy
of the Earl of Airly, was charged with the same commission,
and raised an army of five thousand men to
carry out his trust. Lord Ogilvie was unable to hold
out against such a force, and abandoned his father's
stronghold, which, as well as his own residence of
Forthar, was plundered and utterly destroyed by Argyle.
Lady Ogilvie is said to have been pregnant at
the time of the burning of Forthar, and to have undergone
considerable danger before she could find proper
refuge. She never had, however, more than one son,
though she is endowed with no fewer than ten by the
ballads. According to one account, the event here
celebrated took place in 1639; another assigns it
to 1640. (Napier's <i>Montrose and the Covenanters</i>,

in Hogg's <i>Jacobite Relics</i>, ii. 411. Allan Cunningham,
misled by the Ogilvies' continuing to the Pretender
the devotion they exhibited to the Royal Martyr and
his son, has transferred the burning of Airly to the
18th century. See his <i>Young Airly</i>, in Cromek's

<h3><a name="THE_BARON_OF_BRACKLEY" id="THE_BARON_OF_BRACKLEY"></a>THE BARON OF  BRACKLEY.</h3>


<p>First published as follows in Jamieson's <i>Popular
Ballads</i>, i. 102. The copy used was derived from
Mrs. Brown, and collated with a fragment taken down
by Scott from the recitation of two of the descendants
of Inverey. Buchan has given a different version
in his <i>Gleanings</i>, which is annexed to the present.
"This ballad," says Chambers, "records an unfortunate
rencontre, which took place on the 16th of
September, 1666, between John Gordon of Brackley,
commonly called the Baron of Brackley, (in Aberdeenshire,)
and Farquharson of Inverey, a noted
freebooter, who dwelt on Dee-side. The former
gentleman, who is yet remembered by tradition as a
person of the most amiable and respectable character,
had contrived to offend Farquharson, by pounding
some horses belonging to his (Farquharson's) followers,
which had either strayed into the Brackley
grounds, or become forfeited on account of some
petty delinquencies committed by their proprietors.
Farquharson was a man of violent habits and passions;
he is yet remembered by the epithet <i>Fuddie</i>,
descriptive of his hurried, impatient gait; and it is
said that, having been in league with the powers of
darkness, he was buried on the north side of a hill,
where the sun never shone. On account of the miraculous
expedition with which he could sweep the
cattle away from a fertile district, <i>Deil scoup wi'</i><!-- Page 189 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
<i>Fuddie!</i> is still a popular proverb, implying that the
devil could alone keep his own part with him. This
singular marauder, it appears, from authentic information,
wished at first to argue the point at issue
with the Baron of Brackley; but in the course of the
altercation some expression from one of the parties
occasioned a mutual discharge of fire-arms, by which
Brackley and three of his followers fell. An attempt
was made by the baron's friends to bring Fuddie to
justice; but the case seems to have been justly considered
one of chance medley, and the accused party
was soon restored to society."&mdash;<i>The Scottish Ballads</i>,
p. 147.</p>

<h3><a name="GILDEROY" id="GILDEROY"></a>GILDEROY.</h3>


<p>Gilderoy (properly Gilleroy) signifies in Gaelic
"the red-haired lad." The person thus denoted was,
according to tradition, one Patrick of the proscribed
clan Gregor. The following account of him is taken
from the <i>Scot's Musical Museum</i>, p. 71, vol. iv. ed. of
1853.</p>

<p>"Gilderoy was a notorious freebooter in the highlands
of Perthshire, who, with his gang, for a considerable
time infested the country, committing the most
barbarous outrages on the inhabitants. Some of these<!-- Page 197 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
ruffians, however, were at length apprehended through
the vigilance and activity of the Stewarts of Athol,
and conducted to Edinburgh, where they were tried,
condemned, and executed, in February, 1638. Gilderoy,
seeing his accomplices taken and hanged, went
up, and in revenge burned several houses belonging
to the Stewarts in Athol. This new act of atrocity
was the prelude to his ruin. A proclamation was
issued offering £1,000 for his apprehension. The inhabitants
rose <i>en masse</i>, and pursued him from place
to place, till at length he, with five more of his associates,
was overtaken and secured. They were next
carried to Edinburgh, where after trial and conviction,
they expiated their offences on the gallows, in the
month of July, 1638."</p>

<p>In the vulgar story-books, Gilderoy, besides committing
various monstrous and unnatural crimes, enjoys
the credit of having picked Cardinal Richelieu's
pocket in the King's presence, robbed Oliver Cromwell,
and hanged a judge.</p>

<p>The ballad <i>is said</i> to have been composed not long
after the death of Gilderoy, "by a young woman of
no mean talent, who unfortunately became attached
to this daring robber, and had cohabited with him for
some time before his being apprehended." A blackletter
copy printed in England as early as 1650 has
been preserved. Another, with "some slight variations,"
is contained "in Playford's <i>Wit and Mirth</i>, first
edition of vol. iii., printed in 1703." The piece is
next found in <i>Pills to purge Melancholy</i>, v. 39, and,
with one different stanza, in <i>Old Ballads</i>, i. 271. In
the second volume (p. 106) of Thomson's <i>Orpheus
Caledonius</i> (1733), it appears with considerable al<!-- Page 198 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>terations.
Lady Elizabeth Wardlaw (<i>née</i> Halket)
undertook a revision of the ballad, and by expunging
two worthless stanzas and adding three (those enclosed
in brackets), produced the version here given, which
is taken from Ritson's <i>Scotish Songs</i>, ii. 24. Percy's
copy (<i>Reliques</i>, i. 335) is the same, with the omission
of the ninth stanza, and Herd and Pinkerton have
followed Percy.</p>

<p>The subject of this piece is the abduction of a
young Scottish lady by a son of the celebrated Rob
Roy Macgregor. Sentence of outlawry had been
pronounced against this person for not appearing to
stand his trial for murder. While under this sentence,
he conceived the desperate project of carrying
off Jane Kay, heiress of Edinbelly, in Sterlingshire,
and obtaining possession of her estate by a forced
marriage. Engaging a party of the proscribed Macgregors
to assist him in this enterprise, Rob Roy
entered the young woman's house with his brother
James, tied her, hand and foot, with ropes, and carried
her thus on horseback to the abode of one of his clan
in Argyleshire, where, after some mock ceremony,
she was compelled to submit to his embraces. The
place in which the unfortunate woman was detained,
was discovered, and she was rescued by her family.
Rob Roy and James Macgregor were tried for their
lives. The latter escaped from prison, but the principal
in this outrage suffered condign punishment in
February, 1753.<!-- Page 203 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span></p>

<p>Fragments of the story were printed in <i>Select
Scotish Songs</i>, by Robert Burns, edited by R. H.
Cromek, ii. 199, and in Maidment's <i>North Countrie
Garland</i>, p. 44; a complete copy in the <i>Thistle of
Scotland</i>, p. 93. Chambers has combined the fragments
of Burns and Maidment with a third version
furnished by Mr. Kinloch, and has produced a ballad
which is on the whole the most eligible for this place.

seen the editions above referred to, and also <i><a href="#EPPIE_MORRIE">Eppie
Morrie</a></i>, a ballad founded on a similar incident.</p>

<p>This sort of kidnapping seems to have been the
commonest occurrence in the world in Scotland.
Sharpe has collected not a few cases in his <i>Ballad
Book</i>, p. 99, and he gives us two stanzas of another
ballad.</p>

<h3><a name="QUEEN_ELEANORS_CONFESSION" id="QUEEN_ELEANORS_CONFESSION"></a>QUEEN ELEANOR'S CONFESSION.</h3>


<p>Eleanor of Aquitaine was divorced from her first
husband, Louis VII. of France, on account of misbehavior
at Antioch, during the Second Crusade. Her
conduct after her second marriage, with Henry II. of
England, is agreed to have been irreproachable on
the score of chastity. It is rather hard, therefore,
that her reputation should be assailed as it is here;
but if we complain of this injustice, what shall we
say when we find, further on, the same story, with
others even more ridiculous, told of the virtuous
Eleanor of Castile, wife of Edward I.? See Peele's
<i>Chronicle History of Edward I.</i>, Dyce's ed. i. 185,
188, <i>seq.</i>, and the ballad in vol. vii., 291. Both of
these ballads are indeed pretty specimens of the historical
value of popular traditions. The idea of the
unlucky shrift is borrowed from some old story-teller.
It occurs in the <i>fabliau Du Chevalier qui fist sa Fame
confesse</i>, Barbazan, ed. Méon, iii. 229, in Boccaccio G.
vii. 5, Bandello, Malespini, &amp;c.; also in La Fontaine's
<i>Le Mari Confesseur</i>.</p>

<p>The following ballad is from the <i>Collection</i> of 1723,
vol. i. p. 18. There are several other versions:
Percy's <i>Reliques</i>, ii. 165 (with corrections); Buchan's
<i>Gleanings</i>, p. 77; Motherwell's <i>Minstrelsy</i>, p. 1 (<i>Earl
Marshal</i>, from recitation); Aytoun's <i>Ballads of Scotland</i>,
new ed. i. 196; Kinloch's <i>Ancient Scottish Ballads</i>,

<h3><a name="AULD_MAITLAND" id="AULD_MAITLAND"></a>AULD MAITLAND.</h3>

<p class="center">From <i>Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border</i>, i. 306.</p>


<p>"This ballad, notwithstanding its present appearance,
has a claim to very high antiquity. It has been
preserved by tradition; and is, perhaps, the most
authentic instance of a long and very old poem, exclusively
thus preserved. It is only known to a few
old people upon the sequestered banks of the Ettrick,
and is published, as written down from the recitation
of the mother of Mr. James Hogg, who sings, or rather
chants it, with great animation. She learned the
ballad from a blind man, who died at the advanced
age of ninety, and is said to have been possessed of
much traditionary knowledge. Although the language
of this poem is much modernized, yet many
words, which the reciters have retained without understanding
them, still preserve traces of its antiquity.
Such are the words <i>springals</i> (corruptedly pronounced
<i>springwalls</i>), <i>sowies</i>, <i>portcullize</i>, and many other appropriate
terms of war and chivalry, which could
never have been introduced by a modern ballad-maker[?].
The incidents are striking and well managed;
and they are in strict conformity with the
manners of the age in which they are placed.</p>

<p>"The date of the ballad cannot be ascertained with
any degree of accuracy. Sir Richard Maitland, the<!-- Page 218 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
hero of the poem, seems to have been in possession of
his estate about 1250; so that, as he survived the
commencement of the wars betwixt England and
Scotland, in 1296, his prowess against the English, in
defence of his castle of Lauder or Thirlestane, must
have been exerted during his extreme old age.</p>

<p>"The castle of Thirlestane is situated upon the
Leader, near the town of Lauder. Whether the
present building, which was erected by Chancellor
Maitland, and improved by the duke of Lauderdale,
occupies the site of the ancient castle, I do not know;
but it still merits the epithet of a "<i>darksome house</i>."
I find no notice of the siege in history; but there is
nothing improbable in supposing, that the castle, during
the stormy period of the Baliol wars, may have
held out against the English. The creation of a
nephew of Edward I., for the pleasure of slaying him
by the hand of young Maitland, is a poetical license;<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
and may induce us to place the date of the composition
about the reign of David II., or of his successor,
when the real exploits of Maitland and his sons were
in some degree obscured, as well as magnified, by the
lapse of time. The inveterate hatred against the
English, founded upon the usurpation of Edward I.,
glows in every line of the ballad.</p>

<p>"Auld Maitland is placed, by Gawain Douglas,
Bishop of Dunkeld, among the popular heroes of
romance, in his allegorical Palice of Honour.<!-- Page 219 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is a curious circumstance that this interesting
tale, so often referred to by ancient authors, should
be now recovered in so perfect a state; and many
readers may be pleased to see the following sensible
observations, made by a person born in Ettrick Forest,
in the humble situation of a shepherd: 'I am surprised
to hear that this song is suspected by some
to be a modern forgery; the contrary will be best
proved, by most of the old people, hereabouts, having
a great part of it by heart. Many, indeed, are not
aware of the manners of this country; till this present
age, the poor illiterate people, in these glens, knew of
no other entertainment, in the long winter nights,
than repeating, and listening to, the feats of their ancestors,
recorded in songs, which I believe to be
handed down, from father to son, for many generations,
although, no doubt, had a copy been taken, at
the end of every fifty years, there must have been
some difference, occasioned by the gradual change of
language. I believe it is thus that many very ancient
songs have been gradually modernized, to the common
ear; while, to the connoisseur, they present
marks of their genuine antiquity.'&mdash;<i>Letter to the
Editor</i>, <i>from</i> Mr. <span class="smcap">James Hogg</span>. [June 30, 1801.]
To the observations of my ingenious correspondent I<!-- Page 220 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
have nothing to add, but that, in this, and a thousand
other instances, they accurately coincide with my personal
knowledge."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Scott.</span></p>

<p>Notwithstanding the authority of Scott and Leyden,
I am inclined to agree with Mr. Aytoun, (<i>Ballads of
Scotland</i>, ii. 1,) that this ballad is a modern imitation,
or if not that, a comparatively recent composition.
It is with reluctance that I make for it the room
it requires.</p>

<h3><a name="WILLIE_WALLACE" id="WILLIE_WALLACE"></a>WILLIE WALLACE.</h3>


<p>After the battle of Roslin, we are informed by
Bower, the continuator of Fordun's <i>Scotichronicon</i>,
Wallace took ship for France, and various songs, both
in that kingdom and in Scotland, he goes on to say,
bear witness to the courage with which he encountered
the attacks of pirates on the ocean, and of the
English on the continent. Whatever we may think<!-- Page 232 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
of Wallace's expedition to France, there can be no
doubt that the hero's exploits were at an early date
celebrated in popular song. Still, the ballads which
are preserved relate to only one of Wallace's adventures,
and are of doubtful antiquity.</p>

<p>Burns communicated to Johnson's <i>Museum</i> (p. 498)
a defective ballad called <i>Gude Wallace</i>. A better
copy of this, from tradition, is here given. It is taken
from Buchan's <i>Gleanings</i> (p. 114), and was derived
by the editor from a wandering gipsy tinker. Mr.
Laing has inserted in the notes to the new edition of
Johnson's <i>Museum</i> (iv. 458*) what may perhaps be
the original of both these recited ballads, though inferior
to either. This copy appeared in a chap-book
with some Jacobite ballads, about the year 1750. There
are two other versions of this same story, in which
Wallace's mistress is induced to betray him to the
English, but repents in time to save her lover. <a href="#SIR_WILLIAM_WALLACE">The
best of these is annexed to the present ballad</a>. The
other, which is but a fragment, is printed in Buchan's
larger collection, ii. 226, <i>Wallace and his Leman</i>.</p>

<p>The principal incidents of this story are to be found
in the Fifth Book of Blind Harry's Metrical <i>Life of
Wallace</i>.</p>

<p>Jamieson, in <i>Popular Ballads</i>, ii. 166, and Cunningham,
in <i>The Songs of Scotland</i>, i. 262, have taken
the stanzas in Johnson's <i>Museum</i> as the basis of ballads
of their own.</p>

<p>From <i>The Ballads and Songs of Ayrshire</i>, First
Series, p. 74, where it is taken from a <i>Statistical Account
of the Parish of Loudoun</i>. The writer of the
<i>Statistical Account</i> states that the old castle of Loudoun
is supposed to have been destroyed by fire about 350
years ago. "The current tradition," he adds, "ascribes
that event to the Clan Kennedy, and the remains
of an old tower at Auchruglen, on the Galston
side of the valley, is still pointed out as having been
their residence."</p>

<h3><a name="MACPHERSONS_RANT" id="MACPHERSONS_RANT"></a>MACPHERSON'S RANT.</h3>


<p>This ballad, worthy of a hangman's pen, was first
printed in Herd's <i>Scottish Songs</i>, i. 161. It is found,
mutilated and altered, with the title of <i>Macpherson's
Lament</i>, in the <i>Thistle of Scotland</i>, p. 52.</p>

<p>The story of Macpherson is given as follows by a
writer in the <i>New Monthly Magazine</i>, vol. i. p. 142,
cited by Chambers, <i>Scottish Songs</i>, i. 84.</p>

<p>"James Macpherson was born of a beautiful gipsy,
who, at a great wedding, attracted the notice of a
half-intoxicated Highland gentleman. He acknowledged
the child, and had him reared in his house,
until he lost his life in bravely pursuing a hostile clan,
to recover a spreach of cattle taken from Badenoch.<!-- Page 264 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
The gipsy woman, hearing of this disaster, in her
rambles the following summer, came and took away
her boy; but she often returned with him, to wait
upon his relations and clansmen, who never failed to
clothe him well, besides giving money to his mother.
He grew up to beauty, strength, and stature, rarely
equalled. His sword is still preserved at Duff House,
a residence of the Earl of Fife, and few men of our
day could carry, far less wield it, as a weapon of war;
and if it must be owned that his prowess was debased
by the exploits of a free-booter, it is certain, no act
of cruelty, no robbery of the widow, the fatherless, or
distressed, and no murder, were ever perpetrated
under his command. He often gave the spoils of the
rich to relieve the poor; and all his tribe were restrained
from many atrocities of rapine by the awe
of his mighty arm. Indeed, it is said that a dispute
with an aspiring and savage man of his tribe, who
wished to rob a gentleman's house while his wife and
two children lay on the bier for interment, was the
cause of his being betrayed to the vengeance of the
law. The magistrates of Aberdeen were exasperated
at Macpherson's escape, and bribed a girl in that city
to allure and deliver him into their hands. There is
a platform before the jail, at the top of a stair, and a
door below. When Macpherson's capture was made
known to his comrades by the frantic girl, who had
been so credulous as to believe the magistrates only
wanted to hear the wonderful performer on the violin,
his cousin, Donald Macpherson, a gentleman of Herculean
powers, did not disdain to come from Badenoch,
and to join a gipsy, Peter Brown, in liberating
the prisoner. On a market-day they brought several<!-- Page 265 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
assistants; and swift horses were stationed at a convenient
distance. Donald Macpherson and Peter Brown
forced the jail; and while Peter Brown went to help
the heavily-fettered James Macpherson in moving
away, Donald Macpherson guarded the jail-door with
a drawn sword. Many persons assembled at the
market had experienced James Macpherson's humanity,
or had shared his bounty; and they crowded
round the jail as in mere curiosity, but, in fact, to
obstruct the civil authorities in their attempts to prevent
a rescue. A butcher, however, was resolved to
detain Macpherson, expecting a large recompense
from the magistrates; he sprung up the stairs, and
leaped from the platform upon Donald Macpherson,
whom he dashed to the ground by the force and
weight of his body. Donald Macpherson soon recovered,
to make a desperate resistance; and the combatants
tore off each other's clothes. The butcher
got a glimpse of his dog upon the platform, and called
him to his aid; but Macpherson, with admirable presence
of mind, snatched up his own plaid, which lay
near, and threw it over the butcher, thus misleading
the instinct of his canine adversary. The dog darted
with fury upon the plaid, and terribly lacerated his
master's thigh. In the mean time, James Macpherson
had been carried out by Peter Brown, and was soon
joined by Donald Macpherson, who was quickly covered
by some friendly spectator with a hat and great
coat. The magistrates ordered webs from the shops
to be drawn across the Gallowgate; but Donald Macpherson
cut them asunder with his sword, and James,
the late prisoner, got off on horseback. He was,
some time after, betrayed by a man of his own tribe:<!-- Page 266 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
and was the last person executed at Banff, previous
to the abolition of hereditable jurisdiction. He was
an admirable performer on the violin; and his talent
for composition is still evidenced by Macpherson's
Rant, and Macpherson's Pibroch. He performed
these tunes at the foot of the fatal tree; and then
asked if he had any friend in the crowd to whom a
last gift of his instrument would be acceptable. No
man had hardihood to claim friendship with a delinquent,
in whose crimes the acknowledgment might
implicate an avowed acquaintance. As no friend
came forward, Macpherson said, the companion of so
many gloomy hours should perish with him; and,
breaking the violin over his knees, he threw away the
fragments. Donald Macpherson picked up the neck
of the violin, which to this day is preserved, as a valuable
memento, by the family of Cluny, chieftain of
the Macphersons."</p>

<p>Burns's magnificent death-song, <i>McPherson's Farewell</i>,
is too well known to require more than an
allusion.</p>

<h3><a name="THE_FLEMISH_INSURRECTION" id="THE_FLEMISH_INSURRECTION"></a>THE FLEMISH INSURRECTION.</h3>


<p>The Flemings, having abandoned their legitimate
sovereign and attached themselves to Philip the Fair,
found at last cause to repent. In 1301, two citizens
of Bruges, Peter de Koning, a draper, and John
Breydel, a butcher, stirred up their townsmen to
revolt, and drove out the French garrison. The next
year, the Count d'Artois, with a superb army, was defeated
by the insurgents at the battle of Courtrai.</p>

<p>This ballad is found in MS. Harl. No. 2253, "of
the reign of Edw. II." and has been printed in Ritson's
<i>Ancient Songs</i> (i. 51), and in Wright's <i>Political
Songs</i>, p. 187. We have adopted the text of the latter.</p>

<h3><a name="THE_EXECUTION_OF_SIR_SIMON_FRASER" id="THE_EXECUTION_OF_SIR_SIMON_FRASER"></a>THE EXECUTION OF SIR SIMON FRASER.</h3>


<p>On the 27th of March, 1306, Robert Bruce was
crowned king at Scone. Immediately thereupon,
King Edward the First sent the Earl of Pembroke,
Aymer de Valence, to Scotland, to suppress what he
called the rebellion in that kingdom. Pembroke attacked
Bruce in his cantonments at Methven (or
Kirkenclif) near Perth, and dispersed his small army,
taking several prisoners of great consequence. Among
them was Sir Simon Fraser, or Frisel, whose cruel fate
is narrated in the following ballad.</p>

<p>This piece has been printed in Ritson's <i>Ancient
Songs</i> (i. 28), and in Wright's <i>Political Songs</i>, p. 212,
and is extracted from the same MS. as the preceding
ballad.</p>

was boasting of his royal rank, "You are indeed a summer
king, but you will scarce be a winter one," alluding to the
ephemeral sovereignty of the Lord of the May.</p>

and is said to have been so confident of the safety or success
of Sir Simon Fraser, that he had offered to lay his own head
on the block, if that warrior suffered himself to be taken;
and (however involuntarily) it seems he kept his word.

first subdued. He remained a close prisoner about eight
months, and was then freed, on entering into the usual engagement
with the conqueror, to which, however, it is certain
he did not think proper to adhere; esteeming it, perhaps,
more sinful to keep such a forced obligation than to
take it. Abercrombie, i. 552.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ritson.</span></p>

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
